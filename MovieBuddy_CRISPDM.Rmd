# **Business Understanding**
Goal: Build a recommender system that provides Top-N movie recommendations for a given userId using:

- Baseline (popularity + average rating)
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- User-based collaborative filtering
- Matrix factorization

Success criteria

- Practical: returns relevant Top-N unseen items for a user quickly.
- Technical: models evaluated using:
  - rating prediction: RMSE / MAE
  - Top-N ranking: Precision / Recall @ N (where applicable)
